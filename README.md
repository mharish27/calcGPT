# calcGPT

I have designed and tested a system that uses a pre-trained large language model gpt2-large and have fine-tuned the model to do the calculations by the LLM model itself instead of using a calculator API, which is what any LLm does for mathematical operations.
Our goal here is to check if the LLM is capable of learning the patterns of basic mathematical operation like addition. I have also tested the models accuracy using various creative prompts instead of directly asking the models what a+b is. my observations are also attached.
